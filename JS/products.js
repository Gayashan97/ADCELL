        name: 'Laminar Airflow Workstations',
        description: 'NuAire Horizontal and Vertical Laminar Flow Clean Workstations utilize the newest technologies in laminar airflow design, materials and manufacturing processes. The clean workstation can be used where clean airflow per ISO 14644-1 is required for the preparation of injectable drugs, IV solutions, tissue culture, optics, microelectronics, and more. The clean bench should not be used for any work that involves biological agents assigned a level of Risk 1 through 4 as classified by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia, since the horizontal or vertical flow offers no personnel protection against these agents. The clean bench should only be used to protect the product from contamination. A significant number of design innovations give the NuAire Laminar flow equipment superior performance qualities in airflow, lighting, noise levels and vibration.',
